        <h2>Quick definitions (plain language)</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Implicit bias</strong> is when your brain makes quick associations automatically—sometimes without you realizing it.
          That doesn’t automatically make someone “bad,” but it can still shape decisions (like who seems “qualified” or “trustworthy”)
          if nobody stops to question it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Intersectionality</strong> is a way to understand how parts of identity (race, gender, class, disability, etc.)
          overlap and change someone’s experience. Instead of treating each category separately, it asks how systems affect people who
          sit at multiple intersections at the same time.
        </p>

        <!-- #comments# Critical reflection: not just links -->
        <h3>Why this matters in tech</h3>
        <p>
          Tech systems often turn human judgments into “rules” (models, policies, ranking systems). If the inputs or assumptions already
          reflect unequal treatment, the system can scale that inequality fast. That’s why it’s important to slow down, test impact across
          groups, and create real ways for people to challenge decisions.

        <h2>Connection back to Code &amp; Power</h2>
        <p>
          A big theme in this course is that technology is shaped by social power—not separate from it. Implicit bias and
          intersectionality are useful lenses because they help us see how “neutral” tools can still reproduce unequal outcomes.
