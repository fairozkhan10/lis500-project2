          This site looks at how technology distributes power—and why intersectionality matters when we talk about who benefits,
          who gets harmed, and who gets ignored.

          <h2>My focus</h2>
          <p>
            A big takeaway for me so far is that tech isn’t neutral just because it uses math or code. Decisions like what data to
            collect, what counts as “normal,” and what gets automated end up shaping real outcomes—especially for people who already
            have less institutional power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Intersectionality helps because it forces you to ask more specific questions than “is this biased?”—like biased for who,
            in what situation, and compared to what baseline.
