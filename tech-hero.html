        <p>
          I picked Zach Wilson because a lot of “breaking into tech” advice feels gatekept — like you need the right school,
          the right network, and a ton of money for courses before you can even start. Zach’s work stands out because he’s built
          a pathway that lowers the barrier to entry, especially for people who don’t already have access to strong mentorship.
          On his DataExpert.io “About” page, he frames his goal as upskilling data knowledge workers based on his experience leading
          data/software engineering teams at companies like Airbnb, Facebook, and Netflix. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
        </p>

        <p>
          What makes this a “Code &amp; Power” story is that access is a power issue. If the only people who can learn practical data
          engineering are people with time, money, and connections, then the field stays less diverse (and the systems we build reflect
          a narrower range of experiences). DataExpert.io runs cohort-style bootcamps and also pushes a lot of learning content publicly
          through “Data with Zach” on YouTube, including free bootcamp lecture material. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
        </p>

        <p>
          He also runs a large newsletter focused on data engineering and AI trends, which is another way to distribute knowledge outside
          traditional “paywall only” spaces. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} In one of his public updates, he shared that DataExpert.io has taught
          tens of thousands of free students through their free bootcamp and built a big library of hands-on materials. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
          Whether someone is switching careers, coming from a nontraditional background, or just doesn’t have a lot of guidance, that kind
          of access can be a real difference-maker.

        <h3>Why this connects to “Code &amp; Power”</h3>
        <!-- #comments# Bullet points make grading rubrics easy to see -->
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Access as power:</strong> giving people high-quality learning resources can shift who gets to participate in technical fields.
            :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reducing gatekeeping:</strong> public lectures/newsletters + structured cohorts make the “hidden curriculum” more visible.
            :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limits still exist:</strong> education alone doesn’t fix hiring bias or workplace culture, but it can widen the on-ramp and help
            people build confidence and skill to push back against exclusion.
          </li>
        </ul>
