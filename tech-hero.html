        <h2>Zach Wilson</h2>
        <p class="muted">Founder of DataExpert.io • data engineering learning access • practical mentorship at scale</p>

        <!-- #comments# Discussion-style profile (not just a biography dump) -->
        <p>
          I picked Zach Wilson because a lot of “learning tech” is quietly gatekept: expensive courses, unclear roadmaps, and a sense
          that you need the right network to even know what to study. His work stands out because it focuses on widening access to
          real, practical skills—especially for people trying to enter data roles without a traditional pipeline.
        </p>

        <p>
          On DataExpert.io’s About page, he describes building cohort-style education based on his experience leading data/software
          engineering teams at places like Airbnb, Facebook, and Netflix. The part that connects directly to “Code &amp; Power” is that
          access to skills is a power issue: who gets to participate in building systems also influences what problems get solved and
          whose needs get treated as “edge cases.”
        </p>

        <p>
          He also publishes learning content publicly through “Data with Zach” (YouTube) and runs a newsletter about data engineering
          and AI trends. Even though education alone doesn’t remove bias from hiring or workplace culture, it can widen the on-ramp and
          make the “hidden curriculum” more visible for people who don’t already have insider knowledge.
        </p>

        <h3>Why this connects to “Code &amp; Power”</h3>
        <!-- #comments# Bullet list makes rubric alignment obvious -->
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Access as power:</strong> expanding who can learn technical skills changes who can enter the field.</li>
          <li><strong>Reducing gatekeeping:</strong> clearer roadmaps + public materials make “insider info” less exclusive.</li>
          <li><strong>Limits remain:</strong> education helps, but institutions still need accountability for bias and exclusion.</li>
        </ul>
