        <p>
          I’m taking LIS 500 because I want to understand the “power layer” behind technology—who gets represented, who gets excluded,
          and how design choices quietly become social rules. I’m interested in data and backend systems, so it’s useful (and honestly
          kind of uncomfortable sometimes) to see how “efficiency” can also mean surveillance, unequal access, or unfair outcomes.
        </p>

        <!-- #comments# Personal connection: one or two interests to keep it human -->
        <p>
          Outside of class, I’m drawn to building projects that organize information (dashboards, pipelines, APIs), but this course
          pushes me to ask: what assumptions are hiding in the data? who is missing? and what happens when errors hit the same groups
          repeatedly?

            If you’re new to these topics, the <a href="ib-resources.html">Implicit Bias Resources</a> page is written like a
            “subject guide” for first-year students. The <a href="tech-hero.html">Tech Hero</a> page is a short profile showing
            how access and equity can be advanced through community + education work.
